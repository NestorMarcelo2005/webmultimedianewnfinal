      <h2>1. A Kickstart to What Formula 1 Is Today</h2>
      <p>Formula 1 is no longer just a motor race — it’s a global phenomenon. It combines cutting-edge technology, elite engineering, global media, high-stakes competition, and international diplomacy into one of the most complex and captivating sports on Earth. With races in over 20 countries across five continents, F1 is more than speed — it’s influence, innovation, and spectacle rolled into a traveling mega-event.</p>
      <p>From the narrow streets of Monaco to the heat of Qatar, F1 represents a unique fusion of tradition and transformation. The roar of engines, the glint of carbon fiber, and the passionate rivalries make F1 a cultural and economic force — pushing boundaries on and off the track.</p>

      <h2>2. Four Days That Move a Nation</h2>
      <p>Each Formula 1 race isn’t just a Sunday spectacle — it’s a four-day operation that transforms cities, mobilizes thousands, and captivates millions. The weekend begins on Thursday, a media day where drivers meet the press, fans gather for autographs, and teams run system checks. On Friday, engines ignite for the first time. Saturday brings qualifying — a high-intensity battle for pole position. Sunday is race day. Streets are closed, grandstands are packed, and the race unfolds in a few dramatic hours, but its impact ripples far beyond the chequered flag.</p>

      <h2>3. The Impact of Street Circuits</h2>
      <p>Street circuits are where the beauty and chaos of F1 collide. Races like Monaco, Baku, and Singapore are staged not on dedicated race tracks, but on the everyday roads of vibrant cities. These circuits are visually breathtaking — with cars weaving past casinos, skyscrapers, and sea harbors at 300 km/h — but they also bring weeks of disruption to local life. In return, they witness their city take the global stage.</p>

      <h2>4. Pollution and Progress</h2>
      <p>For years, Formula 1 has faced criticism for its environmental toll — carbon emissions, freight fuel, and noise pollution. But the sport is evolving. With a commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2030, F1 is becoming a platform for sustainability innovation. New hybrid engines, sustainable fuels, local food sourcing, electric shuttles, and circular waste systems are all part of the shift.</p>

      <h2>5. The Netflix Effect – <em>Drive to Survive and the New Movie</em></h2>
      <p>Formula 1's global surge in popularity owes a great deal to the Netflix docuseries <em>Drive to Survive</em>. This show pulled back the curtain on the drama behind the scenes — rivalries, heartbreaks, team politics, and personal triumphs. For new fans, it turned F1 from a technical sport into a human story. Since its debut in 2019, the series has introduced millions to the sport, especially in the US and younger demographics.</p>
      <p>The series highlights that Formula 1 isn't just about who finishes first — it's about strategy, resilience, relationships, and ambition. It has become a cultural bridge that reshaped how audiences perceive motorsport and turned F1 drivers into global celebrities.</p>
      <p>Building on this wave of popularity, an upcoming <strong>Hollywood F1 movie</strong> produced by Apple Studios and directed by Joseph Kosinski (director of <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>) is currently in production. The film stars Brad Pitt as a veteran driver returning to the grid to mentor a rising talent. With support from Lewis Hamilton as co-producer and on-track filming during real F1 weekends, the movie promises to bring an unprecedented level of realism and excitement. It’s yet another step in bringing the thrill of Formula 1 to an even wider global audience.</p>

      <h2>6. Women in Formula 1 – Breaking the Grid Barrier</h2>
      <p>While Formula 1 has long been a male-dominated sport, recent years have seen a growing push for gender diversity — both on and off the track. Initiatives like the <strong>F1 Academy</strong>, launched in 2023, aim to develop young female drivers and create real pathways toward racing at the highest level. Supported by F1 teams and leadership, this all-female series is helping bridge the gap that has kept women from competing in Formula 1 for decades.</p>
      <p>Beyond driving, women are increasingly visible in F1 as engineers, strategists, mechanics, and broadcasters — reshaping the culture of the paddock. As representation improves, so does inspiration for the next generation. The road to equality is still long, but with talent, visibility, and investment growing, the future grid could finally reflect a more inclusive version of the sport.</p>
