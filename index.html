      <h2>1. Introduction: What Is Formula 1 Today?</h2>
      <div class="image-text-section">
        <div class="text-side">
          <p>Formula 1 is no longer just a European motorsport — it’s a truly global spectacle. The 2025 calendar stretches across every continent except Antarctica, with 24 races spanning from the deserts of Bahrain to the neon-lit streets of Las Vegas. These events are not merely sporting competitions; they are national showcases that attract millions of viewers and visitors, stimulate local economies, and influence urban planning and policy. F1 embodies a unique blend of engineering precision, high-stakes competition, and international cooperation, making it one of the most complex and far-reaching sports on the planet.</p>
          <p>Each race weekend is a four-day mega event. Thursday features media briefings and preparation, Friday hosts two free practice sessions, Saturday is for qualifying, and Sunday is the race. This structure transforms host cities into bustling motorsport hubs with closed streets, full hotels, packed restaurants, and round-the-clock media coverage. It’s a finely tuned machine — but it comes with both opportunity and cost.</p>
          <p>To keep up with growing concerns about climate impact and sustainability, Formula 1 has initiated a range of environmental reforms. These include using hybrid power units that combine internal combustion engines with electric motors, adopting carbon offsetting policies, and reducing single-use plastics in event infrastructure. While F1 still has a long road ahead, these steps reflect a conscious shift in mindset — one where racing performance must increasingly coexist with environmental accountability.</p>

      <h2>2. Four Days That Move a Nation</h2>
      <div class="image-text-section">
        <div class="text-side">
          <p>Behind every Grand Prix lies a whirlwind of logistical coordination, planning, and execution. Thursday kicks off with press conferences, media interviews, and safety inspections. It’s when drivers speak to fans and journalists, and teams finalize car setups. Friday’s practice sessions give engineers vital data on tire wear, fuel consumption, and track behavior. Saturday’s qualifying session often proves more thrilling than the race itself, as drivers push to the absolute limit in single-lap shootouts. Sunday is race day — the moment everything builds toward — with global TV audiences in the hundreds of millions and crowds that fill cities to capacity.</p>
          <p>The event turns each host city into a temporary capital of motorsport. Local governments coordinate transport networks, emergency services, crowd control, hospitality, and telecommunications to manage the influx of people and media. Businesses thrive: restaurants, hotels, rideshares, and tourism companies report record profits. But the pressure on infrastructure can be immense, particularly in densely populated urban areas that must accommodate sudden spikes in demand while maintaining normal services for residents.</p>
          <p>More than just a weekend event, each F1 race is a catalyst for short-term economic activity and long-term city branding. Hosting a successful GP means showing the world that your city is efficient, modern, and globally connected — a feat that often justifies the enormous investment behind it.</p>

      <h2>3. The Impact of Street Circuits</h2>
      <div class="image-text-section">
        <div class="text-side">
          <p>Street circuits like Monaco, Singapore, and Baku are some of the most iconic venues in Formula 1. These races take place on regular city roads, temporarily closed off and transformed into high-speed circuits. The challenge lies in adapting everyday infrastructure — complete with traffic lights, curbs, and tight corners — into safe, FIA-compliant race tracks. To do this, organizers erect kilometers of crash barriers, install grandstands and pit facilities, and often modify pavement for grip and drainage.</p>
          <p>These events create stunning visual spectacles, with night races reflecting off glass skyscrapers or ancient city walls, merging culture with speed. But the transformation comes at a cost. Residents endure weeks of noise pollution, road closures, and transport disruption. Local businesses near the track may flourish — or suffer — depending on their location and access during race weekend.</p>
          <p>Despite the hassle, cities often return to the calendar year after year. That’s because the exposure and prestige offered by hosting a street race can outweigh the inconvenience. These races capture imaginations worldwide and often serve as tourism magnets long after the podium champagne has dried.</p>

      <h2>4. Pollution and Progress</h2>
      <div class="image-text-section">
        <div class="text-side">
          <p>Formula 1’s environmental footprint has long been a subject of criticism. Air travel, freight logistics, tire waste, engine emissions, and the sheer scale of event infrastructure contribute to high carbon output. Street races, in particular, add layers of complexity: idling traffic, detours, construction noise, and excess waste from vendors and fans. The environmental impact is real — and increasingly visible.</p>
          <p>Recognizing this, F1 announced a bold goal: achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. This commitment includes developing sustainable fuel blends that reduce reliance on fossil fuels, optimizing freight transport through smarter logistics, and investing in energy-efficient event infrastructure. Teams are also required to report on their carbon footprints and take part in green initiatives ranging from tree planting to renewable energy investment.</p>
          <p>Host cities are playing their part too. Cities like Singapore and Montreal have introduced electric shuttle buses, biodegradable packaging, and comprehensive recycling stations around the track. While these changes don’t erase the sport’s environmental impact, they mark a shift in how Formula 1 is perceived — from a symbol of consumption to a testbed for sustainable innovation.</p>
